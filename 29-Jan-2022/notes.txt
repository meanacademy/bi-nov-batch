Node.JS Modules
    Module is a piece of functionality that is arranged in a single or several JS files 
    So we can use these modules in application.

    Types:
        1. Built-in Module
            http
            fs
            path

        2. Local Module
            Modules created directly in application are known as local module.

        3. Third-party Module
            Modules that can be downloaded with NPM is called as third party module
            express, mongoose, angular, react
        
        4. To use built-in modules, enternal modules 
            const moduleObj = require('moudle_name)
